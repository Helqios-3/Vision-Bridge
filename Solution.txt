Created an HTML based on example YAML file to first test my code.
Searched for examples about YAML parsing in js but found XML so I tried to replicate it after founding js-yaml parser and its documentation.
I couldn't understand the "." nor "#" on the YAML file at first then figured out that it is needed for query search.
